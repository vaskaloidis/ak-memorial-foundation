### Tasks

- Add GitHub commit notes to timeline
- Add GutHub commits with special code to be added as special note
- Display a list of TODO's pulled from the GITHUB account for hte project
- Add a task list to the Project page, where the owner and customers can assign eachother tasks for each sprint. Those should get displayed under the Sprint Invoice Tasks as well. They do not add to the cost of the project, only the owner can add those to the invoice.
    - Add a "sign-off" feature that a customer has to do after the owner modifies the invoice (sprint tasks) that cost the customer money
- **Integrate Slack into Project View** - so users are notified when they have slack messages.
- Integrate rollbar error notifications as well as failed builds
- Look at Heroku API and see what we can get from there
